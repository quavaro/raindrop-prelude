Raindrop Prelude Visualizer
===========================

This visualizer is made specifically for the song Prelude in D-flat Major Op. 28 No. 15 (Raindrop Prelude). 

The recording I used was performed by Jeremiah Jones, and the file was freely available as of 4/1/2020 at the website Lisztonian here: http://www.lisztonian.com/titles/Prelude+in+Dflat+Major+Op+28+No+15-47.html 

The file must be placed in the folder "public/sounds/" and must be named "raindrop-prelude.mp3" for the visualizer to work. 

You can adjust the speed of the waves (which also determines their ultimate size) with the slider in the top left corner. The wave speed is informed by the loudness, and the stroke weight is defined as an inverse of the spectral centroid value, which is lower in this song when more bass notes are played.
